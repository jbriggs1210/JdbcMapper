Overview
---------

interop-client is a web service control sample.  Serveral key features are demonstrated including:

*) Web service control generation from a webservice WSDL URL.
*) Using JUnit to test a web service control using the ControlTestContainer.

The web service used by this sample is located at:
    http://mssoapinterop.org/asmx/xsd/round4XSD.wsdl

If you like, switch to a different web service by modifing the build.properties file,
note that if the web service is changed it will be necessary to modify the
InteropTest Junit test class.
