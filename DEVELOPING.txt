Developing in Beehive
=====================

Hey; we're glad you're here!  If you're interested in developing Beehive, the 
information below is for you.  First, make sure you've read the introduction
for Beehive contributors here:

  http://wiki.apache.org/beehive/For_Beehive_Developers  

This should help you get started setting up Beehive in your IDE and navigating
what code is where.  

You'll also need to configure your Subversion client to handle end-of-line styles
correctly.  To do this, follow the directions below.

Configuring your Subversion client
==================================

Every text file must have the svn:eol-style property set to 'native'.  This
causes ends-of-line to be translated to the correct format for the local
operating system when files are checked out (e.g., LF on linux, CR/LF on
Windows).  You can do this on a per-file basis using the 'svn propset' command:

     svn propset svn:eol-style native <file path>

An easier way to ensure that all added files have the right properties set is
to use the "auto-props" feature in the SVN client configuration file.  The
location of this file varies depending on the operating system (see
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook/book.html#svn-ch-7-sect-1).
On Linux/UNIX it is located:

   ~/.subversion/config

On Windows, it is typically located in a hidden directory:

   %SYSROOT%\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Subversion
If you have problems locating this, make sure you can view hidden directory 
contents.

Confirm the "header" named [miscellany] is uncommented.

Then, add (uncomment) the following line under the "[miscellany]" section:

    enable-auto-props = yes

Then, add (uncomment) an "[auto-props]" section (include the [auto-props] 
header as well) with a list of file extensions that will automatically 
trigger the svn:eol-style=native property:

[auto-props]
