This sample is designed to show the build process for the web-service controls.  
The web-service control is generated based on a WSDL and schemas of the 
web-service.  

For a detailed documentation of the build process please see: 
    http://beehive.apache.org/releases/nightly/system-controls/webservices/sample-ws-control-blank.html

The same documentation is also available in this distribution:
    <BeehiveRoot>/docs/system-controls/webservices/sample-ws-control-blank.html

Note: This sample also demonstrates the unit testing of the web-service control.
A test example is shown in the junit/ directory.   To build and run the unit testing 
make sure you have both junit.jar and the optional tasks jar file in ANT_HOME/lib.  
 
For additional information on running JUnit tests with ant see:
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junit.html
