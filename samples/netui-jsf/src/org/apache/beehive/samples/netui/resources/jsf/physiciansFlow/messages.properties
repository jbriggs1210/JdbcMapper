searchPageNoteOne=The search button demonstrates how you can pass a form \
bean to a Page Flow action after handling the command in the backing file. \
In this case a command handler in the backing file is called to check the value \
the user has set for the results format. The annotation on the command handler \
has attributes to specify the Page Flow action to call and the bean to pass to the action.

searchPageNoteTwo=The "detail" links in the results table show that you can raise a Page Flow action directly. \
In this case a request parameter is passed to identify the selected row.

searchPageNoteThree=Another approach is to get the data for a single row directly from \
the JSF Data Model (the action "physicianDetailJSFStyle" in physiciansFlow.Controller demonstrates how this is done).

searchPageNoteFour=The page also shows some JSF specific features. \
Clicking either of the "Physician Type" radio buttons generates a value change event; \
the ValueChangeListener in the backing file toggles the enabled value of the "Specialist Type" menu.

searchPageNoteFive=The results table binds to a JSF DataModel exposed as a Page Flow property \
and a JSF dataTable tag is used to display the results. \
Sorting is an intra page event so the sorting links call command handler actions in the backing file \
rather than Page Flow actions.

physicianDetailPageNoteOne=The links at the top of the page call Page Flow actions (don't forget \
to put commandLinks into an <h:form>).

physicianDetailPageNoteTwo=The send mail link demonstrates how to pass a form bean directly to a Page Flow \
action. The attribute tag nested in the command tag provides the necessary name value pair.

but note that the form bean must be declared in the backing file. The code below also shows how \
actionOutputs are used to pass values on to the next page.

physicianDetailPageNoteThree=The list of hospitals is handled with a jstl "forEach" tag. \
The JSF "verbatim" tag is used to make sure the jstl output is rendered correctly.

detailedResultsPageNoteOne=This page uses a JSF dataTable tag around a JSF panelGrid to display the list of results.
