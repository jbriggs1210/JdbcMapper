Beehive Controls + Spring Framework Sample
==========================================

This sample directory contains examples of integrating Beehive Controls with the Spring Framework.  
It uses the bean definition, instantiation, and configuration services of Spring to use JavaBeans 
that have been authored as Controls.

Directories
===========

* external/ - contains the Spring jar file used by the sample.  This is the full Spring jar from 
the 1.1.5 distribution.  This sample has also been tested with the 1.2 Spring JAR.  

* src-spring-integration/ - contains the implementation of the ControlFactory SPI interface for controls, that 
will use Spring to instantiate and configure Controls.

* src/ and web/ - sample webapp that uses Spring and Controls together.  The sample includes a basic Control type 
with properties modeling a Person that can nested children, two corresponding implementations (AdultImpl/MinorImpl), 
and provides a sample Spring bean definition (application.xml) and web application (web.xml) configuration files 
that show how configure Spring/Controls to be used together.  A simple JSP page (familyTree.jsp) demonstrates 
how the defined beans can be instantiated and used.

Building
========

The Spring integration jar can be built using the following commands 
from the samples/controls-spring directory:

    ant build.spring-integration

The sample webapp can be built and deployed to Tomcat using the following
commands from the samples/controls-spring directory:

    ant build
    ant war
    cp springControls.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps

Once deployed, the demo JSP page can be accessed at:

    /springControls/familyTree.jsp

This JSP will show a tree of people that is configured using the applicationContext.xml file
stored in web/WEB-INF.  This tree is generated by walking down the PersonBean types that
are declared in the Spring config file.
