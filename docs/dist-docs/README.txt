APACHE BEEHIVE
 
  Welcome to Beehive!


What is Beehive?
================
  
  The goal of Beehive is to make J2EE programming easier by using JSR-175 metadata annotations
  to simplify the most complex J2EE coding tasks. Beehive is divided into three
  sub-projects:

     Page Flows -- Page Flows are built on top of Struts. The JSR-175 programming model
                   allows for automatic updating of Struts configuration files as well as
                   easy tooling inside of IDEs.

     Controls -- Controls are a framework for building lightweight J2EE components.

     Web Services -- The web services project implements JSR-181, a metadata annotation
                     driven programming model for web services.
