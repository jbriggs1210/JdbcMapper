    This example uses a frameset and a couple of frames.  In the left frame is a <b>Tree</b> where a selection event will 
    populate the right frame.  The tree can be expanded an collapsed.  The way this works is that the target of the 
    The <b>treeItems</b> set an href and a target of the other frame.  The tree must set a different action and a target of the
    containing frame for the expansion target.
